As I navigate this world, exploring and learning from the lives around me, Iâ€™m struck by a simple truth: Despite our differences, we share this planet and its history.

In the last twenty years, I've worked in the technology and Cybersecurity industries. I've witnessed a constant stream of innovations claiming to revolutionize our world for the better. While I admire this drive for progress, an encounter in 2018 shifted my perspective.

In 2018, I dived and snorkeled into the Pacific Ocean. I was surrounded by jellyfish, which have thrived for over 500 million years. Their silent endurance challenged my assumptions about human innovation and dominance. These ancient beings, often overlooked, possess resilience and adaptability.

It dawns on me that I've missed the most crucial point, that real technology isn't developed in laboratories and offices in big buildings but thrives in the forests, mountains, and oceans.  The intricate systems of nature, honed over millennia, often surpass our inventions in elegance and efficiency.  Many of our 'breakthroughs' merely echo solutions that nature has already perfected, reminding me that we are not the sole innovators but students in a world teeming with ancient wisdom.

It may be time for a dose of `humility.` We are not the sole architects of progress but rather part of a grand tapestry woven with countless life forms. With their ancient wisdom, the jellyfish remind me that true advancement lies in technological leaps in harmonizing with the natural world and learning from its enduring inhabitants.
